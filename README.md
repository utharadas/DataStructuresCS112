# DataStructuresCS112
Spring 2023
Welcome to Data Structures, CS112. After completing the course the student will be able to:

Analyze runtime efficiency of algorithms related to data structure design.
Select appropriate abstract data types for use in a given application.
Compare data structure tradeoffs to select the appropriate implementation for an abstract data type.
Design and modify data structures capable of insertion, deletion, search, and related operations.
Combine data structures to build more complex implementations.
Trace through and predict the behavior of algorithms (including code) designed to implement data structure operations.
Identify and remedy errors/inefficiencies in a data structure implementation that may cause its behavior to differ from the intended outcomes.
Design data structures and associated algorithms to meet specified performance requirements for given task specifications.
We use the Java programming language for all assignments and exams in the course
